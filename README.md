Implementing an ```Automated Penetration Testing``` (aka ```APT```) software in order to perform
pen-tests automatically over your cloud cluster to test our ```SaaS``` applications. With ```APT```
you can check your system security when facing unwanted attacks. This project is my ```bachelor```
project at ```Amirkabir University of Tehran```.
